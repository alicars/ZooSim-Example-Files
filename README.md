# ZooSim-Example-Files

After the human apocalypse, only animals are left behind... And these animals are trapped in the zoo! ZooSim is an adventure exploration game with minigames and lots of funny zoo animals! 
You can find ZooSim on steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1482790/ZooSim/

I've included one sample file, the loading manager, which is the highest level manager for all saving and loading in the game.
The game is in Unity and the scripts in C#
